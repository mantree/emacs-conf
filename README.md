# Clojure focused emacs config

This has largely been ripped off the configuration made available for Clojure for the Brave and True. That provided paredit, clojure, cider, ido setup and some other bits and bobs.

On top of that it's got:

* flycheck, error highlighting from eastwood, kibit and core.typed.
* git-gutter, file modifcations shown in buffer gutters.
* ac-cider, autocomplete with documentation popup.
* Solarized theme.

And it all actually works!
